  # Preparing for the project!

  I learned the hard way, that you have to plan everything as thoroughly as possible with any project
  one is working on. One planning tool I found helpful was Trello. This is not only a great tool for groups
  to use on group projects, but it is also very helpful to keep yourself on track with all the things
  you want to complete during a sprint. I used Trello to keep track of features, TODOs, future plans, and the order of steps I needed to take.
